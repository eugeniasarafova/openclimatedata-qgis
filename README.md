# 🛰️ Copernicus & QGIS Climate Data Visualization Guide

This Jupyter Notebook provides markdown-only instructions for downloading climate projection data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) in NetCDF format and visualizing it using QGIS. The focus is on **projected heatwave days** under different climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), using **open tools** and open data.

## 📂 Contents

- `copernicus_qgis_instructions.ipynb` – step-by-step markdown notebook (no code)
- Example settings for selecting and downloading NetCDF data from CDS
- Instructions for installing QGIS and loading NetCDF layers

## 🔓 Data

The data referenced in this notebook is freely available via the  
[Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).  
Variables include:
- ✅ Heatwave days  
- ✅ RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projections  
- ✅ Health-related definitions  
- ✅ Ensemble members average

The downloaded format used in QGIS is: `.nc` (NetCDF).
